# Generative_Adversarial_networks_LIVE


## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VPQHbMvGzg) video by Siraj Raval on Youtube for the Intro to Deep Learning Nanodegree course with Udacity. We're going to build a Generative Adversarial Network capable of generating images using the MNIST handwritten character dataset as training data.
